## Physical layer

- Represents the physical devices that interconnet computers
- is about cabling, connectors and sending signals

## Data link layer

- is responsible for defining a common way of interpreting these signals so network devices can communicate
- 예) 이더넷 

## Network layer ( = Internet layer)

- Allows different networks to communicate with each other through devices known as routers
- 데이터가 네트워크들 간에 전달되도록 하는 계층
- 예) IP, Internet Protocol
- Internetwork 
  - A collection of networks connected together through routers, the most famous of these being the Internet

## Transport layer

- Sorts out whicth client and server programs are supposed to get that data
- TCP/UDP

# Broadband

- Any connectivity technology that isn't dial-up internet

## T-carrier technologies

- originally invented by AT&T in order to transmit multiple phone calls over a single link
  - require dedicated lines
- Transmission System 1, the first T-carrier specification, called T1 for short. With the T1 specification, AT&T invented a way to carry up to 24 simultaneous phone calls across a single piece of twisted pair copper

## Digital Subscriber Lines(DSL)

- traditional dial-up technology보다 많은 데이터를 보낼 수 있었음
- the most common types
  - **ADSL(Asymmetric Digital Subsriber Line)**
    - ADSL connections feature different speeds for outbound and incoming data.
    - 빨라진  다운로드 속도와 느려진 업로드 속드
  - **SDSL(Symmetric Digital Subsriber Line)**
    -  is basically the same as ADSL except the upload and download speeds are the same.
    - SDSL is now more common for both businesses and home users. 
    - Most SDSL technologies and have an upper cap of 1.544 megabits a second or the same as a T1 line

## Cable Broadband

- By using frequencies that don't interfere with television broadcast, cable-based Internet access technologies were able to deliver high speed Internet access across these same cables. 

## Fiber Connections

FTTN

FTTB

Optical Network Terminator(ONT)

- Converts data from protocols the fiber network can understand, to those that more traditional, twisted-pair copper networks can understand

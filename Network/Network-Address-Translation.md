# Network Address Translation (NAT)

- A technology that allows a gateway, usually a router or firewall, to rewrite the source IP of an outgoing IP datagram while retaining the original IP in order to rewrite it into the response

## NAT and Transport Layer

Port preservation

- A technique where the source port chosen by a client is the same port used by the router

Port forwarding

- A technique where specific destination ports can be configured to always be delivered to specific nodes

## NAT, Non-Routable Address Space and the Limits of IPv4

Five RIRs(regional internet registers)

- AFRINC serves the continent of Africa
- ARIN serves the US, Canada and parts of the Caribbean
- APNIC is responsible for most of Asia, Australia, New Zealand and Pacific island nations
- LACNIC covers Central and South America and any parts of the Caribbean not covered by ARIN
- RIPE serves Europe, Russia, the Middle East and portions of Central Asia

그러나 각 지역마다 점차 IPv4의 IP주소가 바닥나기 시작
